    <h1>Hi! I'm building a fake Gatsby site as part of a tutorial!</h1>

      What do I like to do? Lots of course but definitely enjoy building
      websites.

   <h1>Richard Hamming on Luck</h1>
   <div style={{margin: '3rem auto', maxWidth:600 }}>
     <p>
       From Richard Hamming’s classic and must-read talk, “<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">
         You and Your Research
       </a>”.
     </p>
     <blockquote>
       <p>
         There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn’t. The prepared
         mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it
         is luck.{" "}
         <em>
           The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is
           not.
         </em>
