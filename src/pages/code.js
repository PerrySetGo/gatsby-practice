    <p>I've been working with code for a really long time - since 1997 to be exact.
    I was 17 and got on the internet for the first time, and had a my first website coded together about two weeks later. With just a few simple skills, anyone can publish a page and share their knowledge with the world.

    That passion hasn't changed since 1997. While I've ducked in and out of technology over the years, broadly speaking, my interests include:
    </p>
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>All things OOP - I do a lot of work with Java and it really makes me value strict typing.(Typescript!)</li>
      <li>Web development with JavaScript frameworks - I'm currently learning all about react! </li>
      <li>API development with Java (Spark) and JavaScript (Express and node)</li>
      <li>NoSQL Databases such as firebase and mongodb</li>
      <li>Architecture -> decision making</li>
      <li>Automation</li>
      <li>Data viz</li>
      <li>Progressive Web Apps and multiplatform solutions</li>
      <li>Mobile development for android</li>
      <li>Learning more about virtual private servers, dev ops, and deployment</li>
      <li>UX Design and Development</li>
      <li>Hardware hacking, and my Raspberry Pi</li>
    </ul>
